ARM-POWERED INTELLIGENT COOLING SYSTEM FOR
INDUSTRIAL WORKSPACES

This project focuses on developing an enhanced room cooling system using STM32,
tailored for industrial workspaces to improve cooling efficiency and reduce energy consumption.
The system employs a range of sensors, including the DHT11 (temperature and humidity), PIR
(motion detection), MQ7 (air quality), and ultrasonic sensors, to continuously monitor
environmental conditions and human presence. Based on this real-time data, the STM32 controls
cooling fans and ventilation systems through L293D, dynamically adjusting their ON and off
operation.
This ensures that cooling is only provided when necessary, avoiding energy waste by shutting
down in unoccupied areas or when optimal temperature conditions are already not met.
The system's sensor handling is interrupt-driven, enabling fast, real-time responses suitable for the
dynamic conditions of industrial environments.
By leveraging the combined advantages of automation and sensor integration, this enhanced
cooling system offers a smarter, more energy-efficient alternative to conventional cooling
methods.
It not only improves worker comfort and productivity but also enhances operational efficiency,
making it a highly practical solution for maintaining optimal environmental conditions in
industrial workspaces.
